The ACN Iris 3000 Videophone is a device that has a plethora of capabilities. The custom Linux OS that it ships with allows for root access though SSH. The main goal for this archive is to put together all of the nessessary information, sources, and tools that I've throughout the internet in order to re-purpose this device and to take full advantage of it's hardware capabilities. My personal goal for this device is to essentially turn it into a low-profile Linux box.
